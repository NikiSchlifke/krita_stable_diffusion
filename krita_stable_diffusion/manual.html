<h1>Krita Stable Diffusion</h1>

<p>
    Stable Diffusion is an AI model which can generate images based on text prompts and other images that you
    provide to it. The images you generate can be used to augment your own work, create new art, or just for fun.
</p>

<p>
    This plugin allows you to run the Stable Diffusion model and interact with images it produces directly within Krita.
